	<title>Eric’s Personal Boundaries</title>
</head>

<body>

	<p>Renata,</p>
	<p>I am supportive of you, empathetic to you, and I do my share for you and for our family, Challenging these
	beliefs or disregarding my personal boundaries will cause me to disengage.</p>

	Personal boundaries:
	<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
		<li>Excessive criticism of me or another family member</li>
		<li>Criticism of me or another family member in front of Amelia</li>
		<li>Unilaterally reversing decisions that you and I have agreed on because Amelia is upset about the decision
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I love you very much. I disengage at these times because our history demonstrates that attempting to remain
	engaged during these situations results in a larger conflict and makes it harder to reconnect later.</p>

	<p>Eric</p><br />

	<p>Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
	<p><em>Question:</em> Do you really do enough for me?</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, I do. You live a luxurious and low stress lifestyle in a beautiful home in a safe and
	wonderful neighborhood. You spend your leisure time creating an exceptional garden. These things are all possible
	because of the things I do for you. I also spend time each day doing things specifically for you and for our
	family.</p>

	<p><em>Question:</em> Do I really criticize you that much?</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> Yes, you do. If you truly uncertain how much you criticize me, reread the email and texts that
	you previously sent me when you are angry. I put sincere effort into my responses to those texts and email in hopes
	that one day you will go back and read them so that we will be able to improve our relationship. When you are upset,
	your text and email criticisms are painful. However, your in-person criticisms more painful and are truly harmful to
	us and our family.</p>

	<p><em>Question:</em> Are thing getting better?</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> Not really. We still go through these episodes at least every 1 to 3 weeks. During the episode
	you become angry and aggressive. Looking back at the “triggers” of these episodes (i.e. cheese stick wrapper on the
	counter, vacation plans, request to take a walk in the morning, etc.) your response was unjustifiable and out of
	proportion. On the other hand, setting boundaries and disengaging instead of arguing the topics has made a
	difference.</p>

	<p><em>Question:</em> Do I really view you differently from one day to the next?</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> From my perspective, your view of me can change dramatically from on hour to the next (with no
	warning or cause). I can be held in very high esteem during one interaction, and a short time later I am viewed as
	if I were a completely different person.</p>
	<p>Sometimes it feels like there are identical twin Renatas. One who thinks I am the greatest person that ever
	lived. And her identical twin sister who is sure that I am the scum of the earth. And they switch places
	unexpectedly for a couple days every one to three weeks. The periodic visits of Renata’s twin are extremely painful
	for me, harmful to our marriage, and harmful for our family.</p>

	<p><em>Question:</em> All couples fight.</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> That’s not really a question, but my answer is that our level of fighting and your level of
	aggressive behavior is not healthy or normal in a marriage. Instead it is harmful to us, to our marriage, and to our
	family.</p>

	<p><em>Question:</em> What can we do to improve our relationship?</p>
	<p><em>Answer:</em> Mostly I think it will not change. Sadly, maintaining healthy boundaries and disengaging during
	conflicts are the only coping mechanisms that I have found during our/my search of improvements. I pray for
	more.</p>
